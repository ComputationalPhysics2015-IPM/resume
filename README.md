We want to practice [Mark Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and pull requests.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository.
2. [clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) your fork on your PC.
3. Add a file FirstName_LastName.md to your local copy. 
4. Write your CV in it, don't put very personal iformation since its going to be public. 
5. Add the file to git, commit, and push it. Use this [cheat sheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/) if you need. 
6. Make a pull request and I will accept them.
